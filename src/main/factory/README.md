# Factory
## Definition
`In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method — either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes — rather than by calling a constructor.`

## Where to use
* When a class doesn’t know what sub-classes will be required to create
* When a class wants that its sub-classes specify the objects to be created.
* When the parent classes choose the creation of objects to its sub-classes.
