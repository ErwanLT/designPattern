# Strategy
## Definition
`In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.`

## Where to use
When you want the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
