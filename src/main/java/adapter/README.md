# Adapter
## Definition
`An Adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly. An Adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the clientâ€™s interface.`

## Where to use
- When an outside component provides captivating functionality that we'd like to reuse, but it's incompatible with our current application. A suitable Adapter can be developed to make them compatible with each other
- When our application is not compatible with the interface that our client is expecting
- When we want to reuse legacy code in our application without making any modification in the original code
