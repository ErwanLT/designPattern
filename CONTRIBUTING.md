# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Please read carefully through our guidelines below to ensure that your contribution adheres to our project's standards.

## Code of Conduct

To hold a safe space for all contributors, we expect all project participants to adhere to our Code of Conduct. Please read the [full text](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Issue Tracking

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ErwanLT/markdownGenerator/issues) to track all tasks related to this project.

## Build the project locally

In order to contribute to a project on GitHub, you must first get a copy of the project running locally on your computer. This process is sometimes called a "build process", and every project's process will have different requirements. Some requirements are due to the project being hosted on GitHub, some are due to the programming language used, some are due to the project's dependencies.

There are five steps to building this project:

1. [Set up Git and Install openjdk11](#set-up-git-and-install-openjdk11)
1. [Fork the repository](#fork-the-repository)
1. [Clone your fork](#clone-your-fork)
1. [Install dependencies](#install-dependencies)

### Set up Git and Install openjdk11

All GitHub projects are backed by a version control software called *Git*. You'll need to install in order to contribute to *any* project on GitHub.

This specific project is written in Java and uses openjdk11 as it's runtime. You'll need to [install OpenJDK11](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) in order to run the project.

### Fork the repository

A *fork* is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository lets you to make changes to your copy without affecting any of the original code.

Click **Fork** (in the top-right corner of the page) to copy this repository to your GitHub account.

### Clone your fork

A *clone* is a downloaded version of a repository. Cloning our fork lets you download a copy of the repository to your computer.

Use `git` to clone your fork

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/markdownGenerator
```

### Install dependencies


First, navigate into the project's directory

```
$ cd markdown
```

Next, use `mvn` to install the project' dependencies
```
$ mvn clean install
```

## Submit a Pull Request

Remember how making changes on a *fork* doesn't affect the original code? Well, in order to fix an issue in the main project, you *want* to change the original code. A *pull request* is a GitHub feature that lets you do just that!

There are three steps to submitting a pull request:
1. [Save your changes locally](#save-your-changes-locally)
2. [Send your changes to your fork](#send-your-changes-to-your-fork)

These instructions are designed to explain the bare minimum steps in a beginner-friendly way. If you find yourself hungry for more details (or get stuck), I applaud and encourage you to continue research on your own. You'll find no lack of amazing articles on this topic.

### Save your changes locally

First, get a list of all the files you have changed.
```
$ git status
```

Next, *stage* the file you want to save. This will add the file to a new list that is ready to be saved.
```
$ git add src/xxxxx.java
$ git add src/test/xxxxxx.jav
```

Next, verify that the file has been staged correctly. Notice that the text color has changed, and your file is now in a list that says "Changes to be committed" instead of "Changes not staged for commit"
```
$ git status
```

Finally, save your staged files.
```
$ git commit -m "Implement _check"
```

You'll often hear this process called *committing* changes. It's the exact same thing.

### Send your changes to your fork

With one simple `git` command, you can send the changes you just committed locally to your *fork* on GitHub.

```
$ git push origin master
```

Then open a PULL REQUEST
