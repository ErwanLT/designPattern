# Design Pattern
## [Builder](src/main/java/builder)
When you have a simple object, this pattern is not very useful, but when you begin to have a more complex object and want to have a clear code you can use it without hesitation

## [Composite](src/main/java/composite)
When we want to implement the same interface on leaves and composites so that they are handled in the same way.

## [Factory](src/main/java/factory)
* When a class doesnâ€™t know what sub-classes will be required to create
* When a class wants that its sub-classes specify the objects to be created.
* When the parent classes choose the creation of objects to its sub-classes.

## [Prototype](src/main/java/prototype)
If the cost for creating a new object is expensive and costs resources.

## [Strategy](src/main/java/strategy)
When you want the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
