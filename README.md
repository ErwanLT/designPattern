# Design Pattern
## [Builder](src/main/java/builder)
When you have a simple object, this pattern is not very useful, but when you begin to have a more complex object and want to have a clear code you can use it without hesitation

## [Composite](src/main/java/composite)
When we want to implement the same interface on leaves and composites so that they are handled in the same way.

## [Facade](src/main/java/facade)
Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern adds an interface to existing system to hide its complexities.

## [Factory](src/main/java/factory)
* When a class doesnâ€™t know what sub-classes will be required to create
* When a class wants that its sub-classes specify the objects to be created.
* When the parent classes choose the creation of objects to its sub-classes.

## [Prototype](src/main/java/prototype)
If the cost for creating a new object is expensive and costs resources.

## [Proxy](src/main/java/proxy)
When you want to provides the control for accessing the original object.

## [Strategy](src/main/java/strategy)
When you want the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
